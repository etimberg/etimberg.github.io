      <description>Since late 2014, I have been involved with Chart.js. I am currently a maintainer of the library and have helped it grow and mature.

      <description>vaccine-ontario.ca was a website built during the spring of 2021 to help Ontarians find and book a Covid-19 vaccine. The site was built my a multi-disciplinary team of volunteers who came together to help our neighbours.
