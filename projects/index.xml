      <description>Since late 2014, I have been involved with Chart.js. I am currently a maintainer of the library and have helped it grow and mature.

It&amp;rsquo;s been a great adventure, and my first experience with open-source development. It&amp;rsquo;s scary at times to think that my code gets so much use. Chart.js was also my first experience using the HTML 5 Canvas APIs, but it felt quite natural coming from C++ code that made use of Windows GDI APIs.</description>

      <description>This was a quick tool I wrote for my wife. It allows the user to search a sequence of RNA for locations that could potentially bind with the search sequence. It has options to allow for partial matches where only part of the string matches a location in the RNA sequence.

Correlation with RNA Secondary Structure By using the secondary structure configuration, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to correlate matches against locations that are single stranded.</description>
